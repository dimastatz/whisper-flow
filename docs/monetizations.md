# Monetization
For our project, we will focus on the following monetization strategies:

- Dual Licensing Model: We will release the library under an open-source license for personal and educational use while offering a paid commercial license for businesses. This enables companies to use the library in proprietary projects without open-source restrictions.

- Freemium Model with Premium Features: The core features will remain open-source, while advanced, enterprise-specific features such as extra integrations and performance optimizations will be available through a paid model.

- SaaS Offering: We will create a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) around the library, allowing users to access its functionality through a cloud-hosted platform, with subscription-based pricing for scalable access and ease of use.

These strategies will allow us to maintain open access for the community while generating revenue from enterprises and SaaS users.
